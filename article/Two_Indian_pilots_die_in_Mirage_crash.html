<p><span style="font-family: 'Droid Serif', serif; font-size: 16px;">Two Indian Air Force pilots were killed yesterday when their French-built Mirage 2000 aircraft crashed minutes after take-off. The single-engine jet fighter aircraft manufactured by Dassault Aviation was on a test flight after an upgrade carried out by India's Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL). India had signed a $2.4 billion deal with France in 2011 to upgrade 51 Mirage 2000 fighters.</span></p>
