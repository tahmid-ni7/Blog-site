<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 21px; font-family: 'Droid Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Hosts South Africa won the first of three T20Is against Pakistan by six runs despite the best effort from Shoaib Malik, whose 31-ball 49 eventually went in vain at Cape Town last night.</p>
<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 21px; font-family: 'Droid Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">South Africa, after having won the Test series 2-0 and the ODIs 3-2, rode on skipper Faf du Plessis's 45-ball 78 and Ryan Hendricks's 74 off 41 balls to post a sizeable 192 for six after being asked to bat first. Usman Shinwari was the best Pakistan bowler, netting figures of three for 31in four overs.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 21px; font-family: 'Droid Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Pakistan made a good fist of the chase and reached 85 for two after 10 overs when Hussain Talat was out. They could not hold on to the momentum, however, and lost five wickets for 67 runs in the aftermath of a strong beginning. South Africa's Tabraiz Shamsi, Beuran Hendricks and Chris Morris took two wickets each.</p>
