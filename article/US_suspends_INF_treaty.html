<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 21px; font-family: 'Droid Serif', serif; line-height: 24px;">The United States will suspend compliance with the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty with Russia today and formally withdraw in six months if Moscow does not end its alleged violation of the pact, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said yesterday.</p>
<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 21px; font-family: 'Droid Serif', serif; line-height: 24px;">The United States would reconsider its withdrawal if Russia, which denies violating the landmark 1987 arms control pact, came into compliance with the treaty, which bans either side from stationing short- and intermediate-range, land-based missiles in Europe.</p>
<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 21px; font-family: 'Droid Serif', serif; line-height: 24px;">"Russia has refused to take any steps to return (to) real and verifiable compliance," Pompeo told reporters at the State Department. "We will provide Russia and the other treaty parties with formal notice that the United States is withdrawing from the INF treaty, effective in six months.</p>
<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 21px; font-family: 'Droid Serif', serif; line-height: 24px;">"If Russia does not return to full and verifiable compliance with the treaty within this six-month period by verifiably destroying its INF-violating missiles, their launchers, and associated equipment, the treaty will terminate."</p>
<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 21px; font-family: 'Droid Serif', serif; line-height: 24px;">The United States alleges a new Russian cruise missile violates the pact. The missile, the Novator 9M729, is known as the SSC-8 by Nato.</p>
<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 21px; font-family: 'Droid Serif', serif; line-height: 24px;">Russia says the missile's range puts it outside the treaty, and has accused the United States of inventing a false pretext to exit a treaty that it wants to leave anyway so it can develop new missiles. Russia also has rejected a US demand to destroy the new missile.</p>
<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 21px; font-family: 'Droid Serif', serif; line-height: 24px;">Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters yesterday that the United States had been unwilling to discuss the issue.</p>
<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 21px; font-family: 'Droid Serif', serif; line-height: 24px;">Some experts believe the collapse of the INF treaty could undermine other arms control agreements and speed an erosion of the global system designed to block the spread of nuclear arms.</p>
<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 21px; font-family: 'Droid Serif', serif; line-height: 24px;">European officials are especially worried about the treaty's possible collapse, fearful that Europe could again become an arena for nuclear-armed, intermediate-range missile buildups by the United States and Russia.</p>
<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 21px; font-family: 'Droid Serif', serif; line-height: 24px;">Speaking before Pompeo's announcement, German Chancellor Angela Merkel emphasized the importance of using the six-month window to keep talking.</p>
<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 21px; font-family: 'Droid Serif', serif; line-height: 24px;">"It is clear to us that Russia has violated this treaty ...," she said. "The important thing is to keep the window for dialogue open."</p>
<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 21px; font-family: 'Droid Serif', serif; line-height: 24px;">Senator Bob Menendez, the senior Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, accused Trump failing to grasp the importance of arms control treaties or of having a wider strategy to control the spread of nuclear weapons.</p>
<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 21px; font-family: 'Droid Serif', serif; line-height: 24px;">"Today's withdrawal is yet another geo-strategic gift to (Russian President) Vladimir Putin," he said in a statement.</p>
