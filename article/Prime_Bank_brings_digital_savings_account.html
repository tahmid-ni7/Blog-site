<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 21px; font-family: 'Droid Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Prime Bank yesterday launched a new savings instrument, Prime DiGi, which will allow customers to open an account online and without any initial deposit.</p>
<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 21px; font-family: 'Droid Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">A form will be made available online, which the client will have to fill in and submit with the request to open a new account.</p>
<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 21px; font-family: 'Droid Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Prime DiGi will offer various services, including balance inquiry, account statement, fund transfer, credit card payment, utility bill payment, mobile recharge, insurance premium payment and transaction history.</p>
<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 21px; font-family: 'Droid Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">&ldquo;We introduced the digital savings account considering the demand of the young customers,&rdquo; said Rahel Ahmed, managing director of the bank.</p>
<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 21px; font-family: 'Droid Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">He spoke at its launch at a press conference at Dhaka Club.</p>
<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 21px; font-family: 'Droid Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">People now are reluctant to go to branches for basic banking services like account opening and account statement, Ahmed said.</p>
<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 21px; font-family: 'Droid Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">&ldquo;They prefer completing banking related work through mobile handset or laptop. Considering their needs, Prime Bank introduced the service.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 21px; font-family: 'Droid Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The bank has already transformed itself and moved to the centralised system from traditional banking, he said.</p>
<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 21px; font-family: 'Droid Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Habibur Rahman, additional managing director, and Md Golam Rabbani, deputy managing director, were also present.</p>
