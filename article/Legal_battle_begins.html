<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 21px; font-family: 'Droid Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">With the help of Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Bangladesh yesterday launched a legal battle to recover the full amount stolen from its central bank's reserve.</p>
<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 21px; font-family: 'Droid Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The move came nearly three years after hackers stole $81 million from a Bangladesh bank account with the NY Fed.</p>
<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 21px; font-family: 'Droid Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The BB filed a case with the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York around 7:00am (NY time 8:00pm) against Philippines' Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation (RCBC) and others, including several top executives, for their involvement in a &ldquo;massive and multi-year conspiracy&rdquo; to steal its money.</p>
<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 21px; font-family: 'Droid Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The case was lodged online with the court at Manhattan in New York City and the court accepted the lawsuit immediately, Abu Hena Mohd Razee Hassan, head of BB's Bangladesh Finance Intelligence Unit (BIFU), told The Daily Star.</p>
<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 21px; font-family: 'Droid Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">"The Federal Reserve Bank of New York will extend its full cooperation in the legal process and in recovering the money," he said.</p>
<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 21px; font-family: 'Droid Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Meanwhile, in a joint statement, BB and NY Fed said they were committed to work together to recover the stolen funds of BB and bring the culprits to book.</p>
<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 21px; font-family: 'Droid Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">In the case statement, the BB said the RCBC and its senior personnel had full authority and control over the fictitious accounts used in the crime.</p>
<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 21px; font-family: 'Droid Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The first paragraph of the 103-page complaint reads, "This litigation involves a massive, multi-year conspiracy to carry out one of the largest banks heists in modern history right here in New York City."</p>
<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 21px; font-family: 'Droid Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Cozen O' Connor, a large US law firm, filed the case on behalf of Bangladesh.</p>
<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 21px; font-family: 'Droid Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Meanwhile, the RCBC has hired another US law firm to defend the case, claiming the lawsuit was &ldquo;nothing more than a political stunt" to try to shift blame on the corporation.</p>
<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 21px; font-family: 'Droid Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">On February 4, 2016, hackers broke into the central bank's system and generated 70 fake payment orders to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York amounting to $1.94 billion.</p>
<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 21px; font-family: 'Droid Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The NY Fed's security system flagged the payment orders but only five of them fell through and $101 million was released.</p>
<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 21px; font-family: 'Droid Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Of the amount, $81 million was wired to an RCBC branch in Manila, from where it disappeared into the casino industry in the Philippines. The rest $20 million made its way to Sri Lanka.</p>
<p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 21px; font-family: 'Droid Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Sri Lanka sent back the entire sum immediately after the heist was exposed while the Philippines returned $14.54 million in November 2016 -- meaning $66.46 million is yet to be retrieved.</p>
